# kawaii_kinoko_css_sprites

This is a tutorial for making CSS Sprites using kawaii style mushroom images! It's meant to be as straight forward as possible.

I am making this tutorial as I learn how to properly use them myself, so some of the content my be flawed while updating.

I am also making this without using a pre-written framework like bootstrap. I hope to make an entire site with easy, straight forward tutorials that learners can follow without overthinking.
